# Block Everyone üçâ

An easy and fun gamified way to block everyone. No trackers, no accounts, no external assets, no nonsense.

Download the code and use the files in the `build_production` folder to host the game yourself.

You are encouraged to modify, remix, and reuse this code for your needs. It's easy to host it yourself or just run the files from your local machine 
and you should absolutely do that if you are so inclined.

Please submit pull requests with accounts to add to the lists. Preferably with an anonymous account. You never know who is watching :)

Love you bye.
